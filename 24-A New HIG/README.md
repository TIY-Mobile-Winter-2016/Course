# Home Star Wars - A New HIG

  Create a Star Wars App using the UICollectionView we discussed in class today.

You will need *at least* two data models - 

People, (add a few properties but requires created: NSDate)

Make sure you use the NSDateFormatter class to convert the data string returned by the api.

"created": "2014-12-09T13:50:51.644000Z" to NSDate

Create a NavigationController

Create a UITableView with a list of characters.

Create a Detail ViewController with text labels for some of the properties.

Ensure you organize your folders in the project. Models, Views, and Controllers at a minimum.

Use //MARK - to clarify what sections of your code do what and where -- good commenting practices.

Note: This is a precursor project for our lesson Friday on Core Data.
