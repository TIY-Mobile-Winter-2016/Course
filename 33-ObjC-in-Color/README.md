# Homework - iOS Color Wheel - Objective-C App Breakdown

[Justin Meiners](https://github.com/justinmeiners) has written a nice color wheel in Objective-C. Its "a fully scalable and dynamically rendered color picker for iOS."

The objective of this assigment is:

1. Download the source code from [github](https://github.com/justinmeiners/ios-color-wheel/archive/master.zip) or from [dropbox here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4grc8m95rmnkkp7/ios-color-wheel-master.zip?dl=0)
2. Read the README.md file with the instructions given to add the necessary files to ** your own custom objective-c app **.
3. Tomorrow at 9am you will present your App to the class, showing how you reviewed the code, how you implemented the code in your app, and other ways in which you might use the code in the future.
4. You *must* get a value out of the picker, either as a UIColor variable (currentColor) or as the R G B Float values for future use. Display in the console using NSLog.
