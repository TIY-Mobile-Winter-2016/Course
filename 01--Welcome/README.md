### Journal, Week One: The Right Mindset

Create a new repository called `USERNAME.github.io` where `USERNAME` is your GitHub username, e.g. https://github.com/jcgohlke/touchopia.github.io/ Select the CC0 license and elect to create a `README` file for the repository. Create a page in the wiki for your repo called `The Right Mindset`.

Research _The Growth Mindsets_ by Dr. Carol Dweck, starting with the videos provided below. Document your sources on your wiki page, targeting a short (3 - 5 paragraphs) journal entry that includes _all_ of the following:

1. summarizes the two mindsets and characteristics of each
1. **either** describes a personal situation in which you experienced each mindset **or** describes which aspects of each mindset you recognize in yourself
1. explains how you will apply this understanding to your experience at The Iron Yard

If you need guidance, follow [the writing process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_process): start by brainstorming some ideas about the topic and write an outline of your essay, no more than three levels deep, on your wiki page. Otherwise, you can start with your first Rough Draft -- very unorganized, stream of consciousness. 

This assignment will be due on Thursday, but we'll review everyone's work so far in class on Tuesday. _Be sure to link your wiki page in your WIP Issue!_
